# SARS Virus Simulation (Exploration of Graph Networks)

## Overview
Final project for Applied Discrete Mathematics (APPM 3170).  

This project is focused on analysing how a SARS virus spread over different types of graph networks. More details can be found in the writeup, which is divided into two parts: 
1. An introduction and comparison of the two types of networks: co-presence and face-to-face networks
2. An analysis of the simulating virus spread over the networks. 

## Running the Simulations
Anyone can try running the simulations themselves by doing the following:
1. [Install Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/)
2. Clone the project
3. Import the given dataset or one of your own choosing.
5. Run the Matlab scripts.
