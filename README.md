# SARS Virus Simulation (Exploration of Graph Networks)

## Overview
Final project for Applied Discrete Mathematics (APPM 3170).  

This project is focused on analysing how a SARS virus spread over different types of graph networks. More details can be found in the writeups, which are divided into two parts: 
1. A comparison of the two types of networks
2. An analysis of the simulating virus spread over the networks. 

## Running the Simulations
Anyone can try running the simulations themselves by first importing the dataset (or another one of your choosing), and then running the Matlab scripts.
