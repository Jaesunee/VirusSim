# SARS Virus Simulation (Exploration of Graph Networks)
APPM 3170 final project

This project is focused on analysing how a SARS virus spread over different types of networks. More details can be found in the writeups, which are divided into two parts: comparison of the networks, and then running simulations of the virus on the networks. 

Anyone can run the simulation themselves by using the data set and running the matlab scripts with the data imported.
